# Bonsai-coq
A [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) formalization of the Stable Routing Problem and of effective abstractions as presented in the paper [Control Plane Compression](http://beckett.ninja/files/compression2018.pdf).
Only the fact that choice-equivalence implies label and forwarding-equivalence has been proved. 
It remains to show that stable solutions of the concrete and abstract network are choice-equivalent.
